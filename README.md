Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast the closing price of stocks. By utilizing historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance, the model is trained to identify time-series patterns and generate predictions for future price movements. The implementation is carried out in Python using Keras/TensorFlow for deep learning and supporting libraries for data handling and visualization.

Key Features

Data Collection: Automatically fetches historical stock data (e.g., Apple Inc. – AAPL) from Yahoo Finance.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes the closing price values to make the dataset suitable for neural network training.

Model Architecture: Builds a sequential LSTM model capable of capturing temporal dependencies in stock price movements.

Training: Trains the model on 80% of the historical dataset, allowing it to learn key trends and patterns.

Prediction: Evaluates the trained model on the remaining 20% of the data to generate stock price forecasts.

Visualization: Produces a comparative plot showing the training data, actual test prices, and predicted prices to highlight the model’s performance.

Outcome

The project demonstrates how deep learning models like LSTM can be applied to financial time-series forecasting. It provides a foundation for exploring advanced stock prediction strategies, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading systems.
